Make sure you explain what you are doing in each step and why.\n\nPlease make sure you include _all_ of the steps described below. \n\n__You only need to use commands we have learned in class.__\n\n1. Create a new RStudio Project. In this folder, create a simple qmd file called `example.qmd` that can be knitted into a HTML file. Show the result of the knitted file.\n\n2. From the command line interface, initialise this folder as a git repository and push it to a GitHub repository.\n\n3. Create a new branch called `testbranch`. Modify the file `example.qmd` and add the changes to both the local and remote repositories. \n\n4. Create a folder called data, and add the data from Assignment 1 to that folder. Amend the previous commit to include the data folder. Push this amended commit to the remote.\n\n5. Switch back to the main branch and modify `example.qmd` in a different way such that it will conflict with `testbranch`. Commit and push these changes.\n\n6. Merge the changes in `testbranch` onto `main`. Show the conflict and fixing the merge conflict. Push the changes to GitHub, showing the status and changes in GitHub. \n\n7. Tag this commit v1.0 on `main` using an annotated tag.\n\n8. Delete branch `testbranch` locally and on the remote.\n\n9. Show the commit log in condensed form in the terminal. \n\n10. On main, create a new section in `example.qmd` that includes an easy to make plot. Commit the changes, and demonstrate using the command line interface how to undo the commit _without_ losing your local changes.\n\n## Marking Rubric\n\n**Please upload the completed PDF guide to Moodle for marking**\n\n* Each of the instructions will be assessed as to whether they are successfully completed or not (2 marks each, total 20 points)\n* Clear commit messages used in the guide where appropriate (1 point)\n* Guide has good flow and is clear (2 points)\n* Issues with language and grammar: Maximum deduction of 3 points",
