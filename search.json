    "text": "Part A: Setting up version control\nIn this assignment, you need to create an RStudio project that will be able to produce a reproducible HTML report. For the report, please select a data set that interest you from this webpage: Our World in Data.\nThe size of the data set is not relevant, however your data must contain at least 3 numerical variables and a character or factor variable and its size must not be more than 50MB. Your reproducible report should be created using a Quarto file in Rstudio and needs to be knitted into a HTML file. The report must knit into HTML without any errors and must have have all the code and code outputs displayed (unless otherwise specified in the instructions below).\nYou will be working with a GitHub repository for this assignment. We will use GitHub Classroom, where I have set up some of the structure for you. Please join the classroom here. Make sure to choose your Monash username from the list so we can find your assignment.\n\nRepository setup (6 points)\nClone the repository created by GitHub classroom onto your computer as we have done in lectures and tutorials (1 point).\nOnce you have cloned the repository to your computer, make sure to add all the files in the upcoming section, and use relevant, clear commit messages (5 points).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nThe GitHub repo will appear in the GitHub classroom space. Do not work in or create a different repository for this assignment.\n\n\nYou can delete the example files out of Data/ and Images/."

You must provide a link to the location of the data inserted in the text using markdown.\nCreate a table using the kable() function from the knitr R package to report the variable names. Add a table caption that briefly describes the table in no more than 2 sentences. Include a cross-reference to the table in your text.\n\n\nDataset Description subsection (5 points)\nCreate a subsection that will report details about your data. You must include the size of the dataset such as the number of observations, variables and variable types. You must include the following:\n\nA sentence that includes inline R code describing the number of variables and observations in your dataset.\nA screenshot of your inline R code, saved as a png file.

Your camera must be on and recorded together with the workings.\nYou only need to use commands we have learned in class.\n\nCreate a new RStudio Project. In this folder, create a simple qmd file called example.qmd that can be knitted into a HTML file. Show this by knitting the file.\nFrom the command line interface, initialise this folder as a git repository and push it to the GitHub classroom repository.\nCreate a new branch called testbranch. Modify the file example.qmd and add the changes to both the local and remote repositories. Add another commit in this branch where you create a folder called data, and add the data from Assignment 1 to that folder.\nAmend the previous commit to include the data folder.

Inside your Rstudio project create a new Quarto file (File&gt; New File &gt; Quarto document) and call it Tutorial3.qmd. If you are prompted to install some R packages say yes!)\n\nRstudio will create a qmd file with some code inside that produces a plot. You don’t need to modify that.\n\nWe are going to include some data into our Data folder:\n\n\nAdd a new section in Tutorial3.qmd with title: Write data from R into a csv file\nCreate a new R code chunk and type inside write.csv(cars, file = \"Data/cars.csv\"). Press Render. This should create a csv file called cars inside your Data folder.\n\n\nNow we are going to use your Terminal/command line interface/Gitbash to commit the changes using the directly. Please type the following in your Terminal/command line interface/Gitbash:\n\n\ngit add . (or git add * to commit all the changes)\ngit commit -m \"Adding folder Data\"\ngit push origin master\n\n\nGeneral workflow to interact with GitHub using the Terminal:\n\n\ngit clone (A repository is typically clone only one time from the remote repository)\ngit pull (The git pull command is used to fetch and download content from a remote repository and immediately update the local repository to match that content. You should do this every time you star working in your local repository)\ngit status (The git status command displays the state of the working directory and the staging area)\ngit add &lt;file_name&gt; (The git add command adds a change in the working directory to the staging area)\ngit add * (Will commit all the changes)\ngit commit -m \"Message\"(m = message for commit. The git commit is used to create a snapshot of the staged changes along a timeline of a Git projects history.)\ngit push origin &lt;branch_name&gt; (The git push command is used to upload local repository content to a remote repository. )"

You should do this every time you star working in your local repository)\ngit status (The git status command displays the state of the working directory and the staging area)\ngit add &lt;file_name&gt; (The git add command adds a change in the working directory to the staging area)\ngit add * (Will commit all the changes)\ngit commit -m \"Message\"(m = message for commit. The git commit is used to create a snapshot of the staged changes along a timeline of a Git projects history.)\ngit push origin &lt;branch_name&gt; (The git push command is used to upload local repository content to a remote repository. )"
